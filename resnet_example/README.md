## How to run

Start an http server in this folder. You can install [`http-server`](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) via
    ```
    npm install http-server -g
    ```
    Then start an http server by running
    ```
    http-server .. -c-1 -p 3000
    ```

    This will start the local http server with disabled cache and listens on port 3000

Open up the browser and access this URL:
http://localhost:3000/resnet50/
